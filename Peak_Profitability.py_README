This Python script is designed to analyze MT5 (MetaTrader 5) trading strategy performance by processing an HTML backtest report and corresponding market data (CSV). 

Here's a breakdown of its key functions and value-added features:

Key Functions:
File Selection (GUI):
Uses tkinter to provide a user-friendly interface for selecting the MT5 HTML report and EURUSD M5 CSV data files.
Detects file encoding automatically to handle different formats.

HTML Report Parsing:
Extracts trade data (entries/exits, prices, profit/loss) from MT5's Strategy Tester HTML report using BeautifulSoup.
Handles edge cases (e.g., missing headers, varying table structures) to ensure robust parsing.

Market Data Loading:
Loads and preprocesses CSV market data (open, high, low, close) into a Pandas DataFrame, with datetime indexing.

Trade Performance Analysis:

Calculates realized and unrealized peak profits for each trade, including:
Maximum drawdown.
Time to reach peak profit.
Profit potential (difference between peak and realized pips).
Aggregates metrics like trade duration, win rate, and profitability by trade type (buy/sell).

Visualization:
Generates plots comparing peak unrealized profits vs. realized profits and a histogram of profit potential.

Exit Strategy Suggestions:
Recommends take-profit (TP) levels based on percentile analysis of peak unrealized profits.
Suggests time-based exits using median/75th percentile time-to-peak metrics.


Profit Potential: Quantifies how much additional profit could have been captured with optimized exits.
Trade Timing: Evaluates how long trades typically take to reach peak profitability.
Strategy Optimization: Identifies whether the strategy tends to exit too early or let profits erode.


Actionable Insights: Highlights opportunities to refine exit strategies (e.g., adjusting TP levels or adding time-based exits).
Robust Data Handling: Gracefully handles encoding issues and malformed HTML/CSV files.
User-Friendly: GUI simplifies file selection, and visualizations make trends easy to interpret.
