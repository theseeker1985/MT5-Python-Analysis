o	Captures all trade details from the Orders table

3.	Advanced Analysis:
o	Calculates trade durations
o	Determines win/loss status for each trade
o	Computes risk/reward ratios
o	Identifies streaks of consecutive wins/losses
o	Calculates drawdowns

4.	Comprehensive Visualization:
o	Equity curve over time
o	Profit distribution histogram
o	Win/loss by trade direction
o	Performance by hour of day
o	Trade duration vs profit
o	Drawdown analysis
o	Consecutive wins/losses
o	Risk/reward ratio distribution
5.	Detailed Reporting:
o	Summary of key strategy parameters
o	Performance metrics from the report
